# Domain-Specific-Fine-Tuning-of-LLaMA-3-using-LoRA-RAG-for-efficient-text-generation
Due to limited compute, this project uses a lightweight dataset to demonstrate the full workflow: loading LLaMA-3, applying LoRA adapters, domain fine-tuning, building a RAG pipeline, and evaluating improvement in grounded responses.
